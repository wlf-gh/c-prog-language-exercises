This repository contains the excercises I've completed from the book "The C Programming Language", second edition by 
Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie.

Much of the code in these examples is taken straight from the book.  The exercises often instruct the reader to modify code samples from the book in various ways.  My intent is not to claim authorship of this code, the purpose of this repository is to document my progress through the book.
